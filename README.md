# Admin-Dashboard

Welcome to the dashboard! This admin dashboard mock-up to put into practice what I have learned so far with grid and flexbox as well as a showcase of what the personal projects I have made so far with the ODIN project. So, without a further a-do, I present to you the dashboard, admin!
