# Admin-Dashboard

Welcome to the mock-up admin dashboard! The purpose of this project is to simply to put into practice what I have learned so far with grid and flexbox as well as a showcase of what the personal projects I have made so far with the ODIN project. While there's no JS implemented, you can take a look at my other projects to see those logic functionality. So, without a further a-do, I present to you the dashboard, admin!
